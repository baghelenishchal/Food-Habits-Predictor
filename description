Given the data-set of eating habits of people as  P7.csv

Input data-set:

   Taste   Temperature Texture  Eat
0  Salty         Hot    Soft   No
1  Spicy         Hot    Soft   No
2  Spicy         Hot    Hard  Yes
3  Spicy        Cold    Hard   No
4  Spicy         Hot    Hard  Yes

Convert strings into numbers i.e
Replace  (strictly follow the nomenclature)
Salty, spicy and sweet by 0,1 and 3 respectively
Hot and cold by 0 and 1 respectively
Soft and hard by 0 and 1 respectively
No and Yes by 0 and 1 respectively
Store training features (taste,temperature and texture) in variable "X"
Similarly store target feature (Eat) in variable "y"
Build a decision tree model with criterion="entropy" using this dataset to  predict below test  instances
X_test1=[[0,1,1],[2,0,1]]
save the output of testcase 1 in following directory: "/code/P7_eval1.csv"

X_test2=[[2,0,0],[1,0,1]]
save the output of testcase 2 in following directory: "/code/P7_eval2.csv"
      5.  Classify the above test instances


Sample output:

[1 0]
[1 0]
